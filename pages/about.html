        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>About Ayushmaan</h2>
        <p>The <b>AYUSH Startup Registration Portal</b> is here to make it easier for new businesses in the AYUSH sector
            (which includes Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) to get registered. We
            understand that the current registration process can be complex and time-consuming, so this portal was
            created to simplify things. It offers a one-stop solution where startups can easily sign up, submit their
            applications, and upload the necessary documents.

            Startups can track their application status in real-time, receiving updates and notifications at every
            stage, so they always know what's happening. For government officials, the portal provides a more efficient
            way to review applications, verify documents, and either approve or ask for additional information.

            The portal is built with strong security to protect sensitive data like personal and business details,
            making sure everything stays safe. It also offers helpful resources, like FAQs and guides, to assist users
            through the registration process.

            Overall, the <b>AYUSH Startup Registration Portal</b> is designed to remove obstacles for startups, speeding up
            the process and helping new businesses bring their AYUSH-based products and services to the market faster.
            By making the registration process smoother and more transparent, the portal supports innovation in the
            sector and helps integrate AYUSH solutions more easily into mainstream healthcare. The goal is to create a
            more accessible and efficient system that encourages growth in this important area of holistic health.</p>
